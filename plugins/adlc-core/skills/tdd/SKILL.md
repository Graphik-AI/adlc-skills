Read [the ADLC contract](../../references/adlc-contract.md) first. Use the [Claude Code](../../guides/claude-code.md) or [Codex](../../guides/codex.md) guide for the actual host. Resolve nested skills by the relative links below from this package, not by a bare global name.

# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle: consult them before and during the loop, not after.

When exploring the codebase, read `GLOSSARY.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists, and it survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams: where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

Select the public boundary under test from the accepted requirements and existing test conventions. Reuse prior agreement. Ask only if a missing seam decision materially changes the intended behavior or evidence. Do not impose repeated confirmation or add tests for every reversible low-impact edit.

Derive expected results independently from requirements or worked examples; record what mocks bypass and what real integration or data evidence remains necessary.

When the shape of that interface is itself in question (how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose), read bundled [codebase-design](../codebase-design/SKILL.md) for the vocabulary. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms, and it is a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or uses an incidental side channel rather than the chosen interface. When persisted data is the requirement, direct database assertions against independent expectations are appropriate. The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological**: the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth: a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing**: writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead: one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** Use scoped refinement after the behavioral slice is green (see [code-review](../code-review/SKILL.md)), not the red → green implementation cycle.
